We propose a pipeline that takes in a video with a top-down view of two humans playing a chess match as input, and outputs an array of FENstrings, which represents the game state and how it changes over time.

**Instructions**

***Install Dependencies***
- `pip install opencv-python numpy requests torch torchvision pillow`

***Run***
- `python3 detect.py`
